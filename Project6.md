## PROJECT 6: Web Solution With WordPress

To begin with, I launched two EC2 instances using Redhat (not Ubuntu). One instance will serve as the 'Web Server' while the other will serve as the 'Database Server'.

Next, I create 3 volumes in the same AZ (Availability Zone) as my Web Server EC2, each of 10 GiB and respectively name web1, web2 and web3.
